⚙️ How It Works <br>
🛠️ Shell Execution Flow <br>
1️⃣ Displays a Prompt → "Coconut's Shell: /home/user > $" <br>
2️⃣ Waits for User Input → Reads input using fgets(). <br>
3️⃣ Parses Command & Arguments → Uses strtok() for tokenization. <br>
4️⃣ Executes Command → Calls fork() and execvp(). <br>
5️⃣ Handles Timeout (if specified) → Spawns a timer process. <br>
6️⃣ Supports Argument Passing – Run commands with multiple arguments effortlessly. <br>
<br>

⏳ Timeout Handling
CocoBash allows timed execution of commands:

```text
./CocoBash timeout 5 some_command
```
If the command exceeds 5 seconds, it will be forcefully terminated.
